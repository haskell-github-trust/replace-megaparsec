__replace-megaparsec__ is for finding text patterns, and also
replacing or splitting on the found patterns.
This activity is traditionally done with regular expressions,
but __replace-megaparsec__ uses
[__megaparsec__](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec)
parsers instead for the pattern matching.

__replace-megaparsec__ can be used in the same sort of “pattern capture”
or “find all” situations in which one would use Python
[`re.findall`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall)
or
Perl [`m//`](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/m.html),
or
Unix [`grep`](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/).

__replace-megaparsec__ can be used in the same sort of “stream editing”
or “search-and-replace” situations in which one would use Python
[`re.sub`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub),
or
Perl [`s///`](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/s.html),
or Unix
[`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/The-_0022s_0022-Command.html),
or
[`awk`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html).

__replace-megaparsec__ can be used in the same sort of “string splitting”
situations in which one would use Python
[`re.split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split)
or Perl
[`split`](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/split.html).

## Why would we want to do pattern matching and substitution with parsers instead of regular expressions?

* Haskell parsers have a nicer syntax than
  [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression),
  which are notoriously
  [difficult to read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_language).

* Regular expressions can do “group capture” on sections of the matched
  pattern, but they can only return stringy lists of the capture groups. Parsers
  can construct typed data structures based on the capture groups, guaranteeing
  no disagreement between the pattern rules and the rules that we're using
  to build data structures based on the pattern matches.

  For example, consider
  scanning a string for numbers. A lot of different things can look like a number,
  and can have leading plus or minus signs, or be in scientific notation, or
  have commas, or whatever. If we try to parse all of the numbers out of a string
  using regular expressions, then we have to make sure that the regular expression
  and the string-to-number conversion function agree about exactly what is
  and what isn't a numeric string. We can get into an awkward situation in which
  the regular expression says it has found a numeric string but the
  string-to-number conversion function fails. A typed parser will perform both
  the pattern match and the conversion, so it will never be in that situation.
  [Parse, don't validate.](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)

* Regular expressions are only able to pattern-match
  [regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#The_hierarchy)
  grammars.
  Megaparsec parsers are able pattern-match context-free grammars, and
  even context-sensitive grammars, if needed. See below for
  an example of lifting a `Parser` into a `State` monad for context-sensitive
  pattern-matching.

* The replacement expression for a traditional regular expression-based
  substitution command is usually just a string template in which
  the *Nth* “capture group” can be inserted with the syntax `\N`. With
  this library, instead of a template, we get
  an `editor` function which can perform any computation, including IO.

# Usage Examples

These usage examples can be run in a live Jupyter notebook hosted
by [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/). Click the badge to launch:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jamesdbrock/replace-megaparsec/master?urlpath=lab/tree/work/ReplaceMegaparsecUsage.ipynb)

Try the examples in `ghci` by
running `cabal v2-repl` in the `replace-megaparsec/`
root directory.

The examples depend on these imports.

```haskell
import Data.Void
import Replace.Megaparsec
import Text.Megaparsec
import Text.Megaparsec.Char
import Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer
```

## Split strings with `splitCap`

### Find all pattern matches, capture the matched text and the parsed result

Separate the input string into sections which can be parsed as a hexadecimal
number with a prefix `"0x"`, and sections which can't. Parse the numbers.

```haskell
let hexparser = chunk "0x" *> hexadecimal :: Parsec Void String Integer
splitCap (match hexparser) "0xA 000 0xFFFF"
```
```haskell
[Right ("0xA",10), Left " 000 ", Right ("0xFFFF",65535)]
```

### Find all pattern matches, capture only the locations of the matched patterns

Find all of the sections of the stream which are letters. Capture a list of
the offsets of the beginning of every pattern match.

```haskell
import Data.Either
let letterOffset = getOffset <* some letterChar :: Parsec Void String Int
rights $ splitCap letterOffset " a  bc "
```
```haskell
[1,4]
```
### Pattern match balanced parentheses

Find groups of balanced nested parentheses. This is an example of a
“context-free” grammar, a pattern that can't be expressed by a regular
expression. We can express the pattern with a recursive parser.

```haskell
import Data.Functor (void)
import Data.Bifunctor (second)
let parens :: Parsec Void String ()
    parens = do
        char '('
        manyTill
            (void (noneOf "()") <|> void parens)
            (char ')')
        pure ()

second fst <$> splitCap (match parens) "(()) (()())"
```
```haskell
[Right "(())",Left " ",Right "(()())"]
```

## Edit strings with `streamEdit`

The following examples show how to search for a pattern in a string of text
and then edit the string of text to substitute in some replacement text
for the matched patterns.

### Pattern match and replace with a constant

Replace all carriage-return-newline occurances with newline.

```haskell
let crnl = chunk "\r\n" :: Parsec Void String String
streamEdit crnl (const "\n") "1\r\n2\r\n"
```
```haskell
"1\n2\n"
```

### Pattern match and edit the matches

Replace alphabetic characters with the next character in the alphabet.

```haskell
let somelet = some letterChar :: Parsec Void String String
streamEdit somelet (fmap succ) "HAL 9000"
```
```haskell
"IBM 9000"
```

### Pattern match and maybe edit the matches, or maybe leave them alone

Find all of the string sections *`s`* which can be parsed as a
hexadecimal number *`r`*,
and if *`r≤16`*, then replace *`s`* with a decimal number. Uses the
[`match`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec.html#v:match)
combinator.

```haskell
let hexparser = chunk "0x" *> hexadecimal :: Parsec Void String Integer
streamEdit (match hexparser) (\(s,r) -> if r<=16 then show r else s) "0xA 000 0xFFFF"
```
```haskell
"10 000 0xFFFF"
```

### Pattern match and edit the matches with IO with [`streamEditT`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/replace-megaparsec/docs/Replace-Megaparsec.html#v:streamEditT)

Find an environment variable in curly braces and replace it with its
value from the environment.

```haskell
import System.Environment (getEnv)
let bracevar = char '{' *> manyTill anySingle (char '}') :: ParsecT Void String IO String
streamEditT bracevar getEnv "- {HOME} -"
```
```haskell
"- /home/jbrock -"
```

### Context-sensitive pattern match and edit the matches with [`streamEditT`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/replace-megaparsec/docs/Replace-Megaparsec.html#v:streamEditT)

Capitalize the third letter in a string. The `capThird` parser searches for
individual letters, and it needs to remember how many times it has run so
that it can match successfully only on the third time that it finds a letter.
To enable the parser to remember how many times it has run, we'll
compose the parser with a `State` monad from
the `mtl` package. (Run in `ghci` with `cabal v2-repl -b mtl`). Because it has
stateful memory, this parser is an example of a “context-sensitive” grammar.

```haskell
import qualified Control.Monad.State.Strict as MTL
import Control.Monad.State.Strict (get, put, evalState)
import Data.Char (toUpper)

let capThird :: ParsecT Void String (MTL.State Int) String
    capThird = do
        x <- letterChar
        i <- get
        let i' = i+1
        put i'
        if i'==3 then pure [x] else empty

flip evalState 0 $ streamEditT capThird (pure . fmap toUpper) "a a a a a"
```
```haskell
"a a A a a"
```


### Pattern match, edit the matches, and count the edits with [`streamEditT`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/replace-megaparsec/docs/Replace-Megaparsec.html#v:streamEditT)

Find and capitalize no more than three letters in a string, and return the 
edited string along with the number of letters capitalized. To enable the
editor function to remember how many letters it has capitalized, we'll 
run `streamEditT` in the `State` monad from the `mtl` package. Use this
technique to get the same functionality as Python
[`re.subn`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.subn).

```haskell
import qualified Control.Monad.State.Strict as MTL
import Control.Monad.State.Strict (get, put, runState)
import Data.Char (toUpper)

let editThree :: Char -> MTL.State Int String
    editThree x = do
        i <- get
        if i<3
            then do
                put $ i+1
                pure [toUpper x]
            else pure [x]

flip runState 0 $ streamEditT letterChar editThree "a a a a a"
```
```haskell
("A A A a a",3)
```


### Non-greedy pattern repetition

This is not a feature of this library, but it’s
a useful technique to know.

How do we do non-greedy repetition of a pattern `p`, like we would in Regex
by writing `p*?`?

By using the
[`manyTill_`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parser-combinators/docs/Control-Monad-Combinators.html#v:manyTill_) combinator. To repeat pattern `p` non-greedily, write
`manyTill_ p q` where `q` is the entire rest of the parser.

For example, this parse fails because `many` repeats the pattern `letterChar`
greedily.

```haskell
flip parseMaybe "aab" $ do
  a <- many letterChar
  b <- single 'b'
  pure (a,b)
```
```haskell
Nothing
```

To repeat pattern `letterChar` non-greedily, use `manyTill_`.

```haskell
flip parseMaybe "aab" $ do
  (a,b) <- manyTill_ letterChar $ do
    single 'b'
  pure (a,b)
```
```haskell
Just ("aa",'b')
```


# In the Shell

If we're going to have a viable `sed` replacement then we want to be able
to use it easily from the command line. This
[Stack script interpreter](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#script-interpreter)
script will find decimal numbers in a stream and replace them with their double.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
{- stack
  script
  --resolver lts-16
  --package megaparsec
  --package replace-megaparsec
-}
-- https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#script-interpreter

import Data.Void
import Text.Megaparsec
import Text.Megaparsec.Char
import Text.Megaparsec.Char.Lexer
import Replace.Megaparsec

main = interact $ streamEdit (decimal :: Parsec Void String Int) (show . (*2))
```

If you have
[The Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
installed then you can just copy-paste this into a file named `doubler.hs` and
run it. (On the first run Stack may need to download the dependencies.)

```bash
$ chmod u+x doubler.hs
$ echo "1 6 21 107" | ./doubler.hs
2 12 42 214
```

# Benchmarks

These benchmarks are intended to measure the wall-clock speed
of *everything except the actual pattern-matching*. Speed of the
pattern-matching is the responsibility of the
[__megaparsec__](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) and
[__attoparsec__](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec)
libraries.

The benchmark task is to find all of the one-character patterns `x` in a
text stream and replace them by a function which returns the constant
string `oo`. So, like the regex `s/x/oo/g`.

We have two benchmark input cases, which we call __dense__ and __sparse__.

The __dense__ case is one megabyte of alternating spaces and `x`s
like

```
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
```

The __sparse__ case is one megabyte of spaces with a single `x` in the middle
like

```
                         x
```

Each benchmark program reads the input from `stdin`, replaces `x` with `oo`,
and writes the result to `stdout`. The time elapsed is measured by `perf stat`,
and the best observed time is recorded.

for details.

# Hypothetically Asked Questions

1. *Could we write this library for __parsec__?*

   No, because the
   [`match`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec/docs/Text-Megaparsec.html#v:match)
   combinator doesn't exist for __parsec__. (I can't find it anywhere.
   [Can it be written?](http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2014/05/31/attoparsec/#from-strings-to-buffers-and-cursors))

2. *Is this a good idea?*

   You may have
   [heard it suggested](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57667534/how-can-i-use-a-parser-in-haskell-to-find-the-locations-of-some-substrings-in-a/57712672#comment101804063_57667534)
   that monadic parsers are better for pattern-matching when
   the input stream is mostly signal, and regular expressions are better
   when the input stream is mostly noise.

   The premise of this library is that monadic parsers are great for finding
   small signal patterns in a stream of otherwise noisy text.

   Our reluctance to forego the speedup opportunities afforded by restricting
   ourselves to regular grammars is an old superstition about
   opportunities which
   [remain mostly unexploited anyway](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html).
   The performance compromise of allowing stack memory allocation (a.k.a. pushdown
   automata, a.k.a. context-free grammar) was once considered
   [controversial for *general-purpose* programming languages](https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/how-recursion-got-into-programming-a-comedy-of-errors-3/).
   I think we
   can now resolve that controversy the same way for pattern matching languages.
